## Getting a Google Apps API key (Required!)

* Create an application [here](https://console.developers.google.com)
* On the API Manager section, go to "Credentials" and create a new API key
* Enable your application to communicate the YouTube Api [here](https://console.developers.google.com/apis/api/youtube)
* Make sure the following URL works for you in your browser (Change the key at the end!):
https://www.googleapis.com/youtube/v3/channels?part=statistics&id=UCu7_D0o48KbfhpEohoP7YSQ&key=PutYourNewlyGeneratedKeyHere

## Installing

The downloaded code can be included as a new library into the IDE selecting the menu:

     Sketch / include Library / Add .Zip library

You also have to install the ArduinoJson library written by [Beno√Æt Blanchon](https://github.com/bblanchon). Search for it on the Arduino Library manager or get it from [here](https://github.com/bblanchon/ArduinoJson).

Include YoutubeApi in your project:

    #include <YoutubeApi.h>

and pass it a Bot token and a SSL Client (See the examples for more details)

    #define API_KEY "XXXXXXXXX:XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX"
    // WiFiSSLClient client; //For 101 boards
    WiFiClientSecure client; //For ESP8266 boards
    YoutubeApi bot(API_KEY, client);

#UPD: Remaking. Display video statistics.
Channel statistics does not show.

Implemented by:
* View Count
* Comment
* like
* dislike

it is necessary to place the channel id, specify the video id

*NOTE:* This library has not been tested with the 101 boards as I do not have a compatible board. If you can help please let me know!
